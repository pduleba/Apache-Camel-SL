This project logic overview can be found in Quick Overview.png
To make it works it requires (up and running) :
1. Active MQ server (JMS)
2. fulfillmentcenterone-service (JAX-RS Service)
3. FileZilla or any other FTP Server (for FTP Component)
4. Access to directory specified in ConsumeFulfillmentABCOrderRouteTest.fullfillmentABCRoutes()
5. Access to directory specified in log4j.properties files (for main and test)

Known Problems:
In case of runnig all Junit Test, ConsumeFulfillmentCenterOneOrderRouteTest is failling,
but single run of this test works well. I don't know why at the moment - FIX THIS
